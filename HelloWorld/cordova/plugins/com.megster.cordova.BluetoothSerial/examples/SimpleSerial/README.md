# Simple Serial Example

Pair your phone with the remote bluetooth device.

Edit assets/www/js/index.js and set app.macAddress to the MAC address of the remote bluetooth adapter.

Build and deploy the code to your Android device

    $ cd $PROJECT/BluetoothSerial/examples/SimpleSerial
    $ ./cordova/run
    
Sometimes it might take more than one time to connect to the remove device.
